# Next Steps

Now that you have a solid requirements foundation, you're at a crucial transition point where abstract business needs transform into concrete design decisions. Think of requirements as the blueprint's specifications - they tell you what rooms the house needs and how big they should be, but they don't yet show you how those rooms connect or what the house will actually look like when built.

The next phase involves several interconnected design activities that build upon each other systematically. Let me walk you through this progression, explaining why each step matters and how they work together to create a coherent development plan.

## Understanding the Design Progression

The journey from requirements to working software follows a logical sequence that mirrors how architects design buildings. You start with the structural foundation, then work outward to user-facing elements, and finally create detailed construction plans. Each phase informs and constrains the next, which is why the sequence matters so much.
Your requirements document provides the functional specifications, but it doesn't yet address fundamental questions about how data flows through your system, how users will actually interact with complex workflows, or how different software components will work together. These design decisions will ultimately determine whether your application feels intuitive to use and whether it can be built efficiently.

## Data Architecture and Information Design

The first design step involves creating your data architecture, which serves as the foundation for everything else you'll build. Think of this as designing the building's structural framework - you need to understand how information flows and connects before you can design the rooms where people will work.
For your control testing application, this means taking the data entities we discussed earlier and transforming them into a complete data model that shows precisely how controls, testing cycles, evidence, findings, and users relate to each other. You'll need to make concrete decisions about database schema design, including how to handle complex relationships like the many-to-many connections between controls and regulatory frameworks.
This phase also involves designing your information architecture, which determines how information is organized and presented to users. Consider how an auditor should navigate from a testing cycle overview to specific control assignments to individual pieces of evidence. The hierarchical structure you create here will directly influence how intuitive your application feels to use.
Start by creating detailed entity relationship diagrams that show not just what data you store, but how different pieces of information connect and depend on each other. For instance, when a testing cycle is created, what happens to existing control assignments? When evidence is uploaded, how does the system maintain traceability back to specific control testing requirements? These logical relationships need to be designed before you write any code.

## System Architecture and Component Design

Once you understand your data relationships, you can design your system architecture, which defines how different software components work together to deliver functionality. This phase transforms your technical requirements into a concrete blueprint that your development team can follow.
Your requirements specify Go with Gin and gqlgen for the backend, Vue with Material Design for the frontend, and MongoDB for data storage. Now you need to design how these technologies work together to support your specific workflows. Consider questions like how your GraphQL schema maps to your data model, how you'll handle authentication across different user roles, and how evidence file uploads will be processed and stored securely.
Think about this phase as designing the building's electrical, plumbing, and HVAC systems. These aren't visible to end users, but they determine whether the building actually functions properly. For your application, you need to design API endpoints that efficiently support user workflows, database queries that perform well under load, and security mechanisms that protect sensitive audit information.
Create architecture diagrams that show how requests flow from user interfaces through your API layer to data storage and back. Document key design decisions like how you'll handle concurrent users editing the same testing cycle, or how you'll ensure evidence files remain accessible even if storage infrastructure changes. These architectural choices will influence every piece of code your team writes.
## User Experience and Interface Design
With your data and system architecture in place, you can focus on designing the user experience, which determines how people actually interact with your system to accomplish their work. This phase translates your functional requirements into specific screen layouts, interaction patterns, and workflow designs.
Start by creating detailed user journey maps that show how different personas move through your application to complete their primary tasks. For example, map the complete journey of an auditor receiving a control testing assignment, collecting evidence, analyzing findings, and generating documentation. Identify every decision point, potential confusion area, and opportunity to streamline workflows.
User experience design for specialized business applications like yours requires deep understanding of domain workflows that generic design patterns don't address. Consider how an audit manager needs to quickly assess testing progress across dozens of concurrent control tests, or how an evidence provider needs to understand exactly what information an auditor requires without lengthy email exchanges. These domain-specific interaction patterns become your competitive advantage.
Create wireframes and user interface mockups that show specific screen layouts and interaction flows. Design how complex information like testing cycle progress gets presented clearly without overwhelming users. Consider how the same information might need to be displayed differently for audit managers (who need high-level summaries) versus auditors (who need detailed task lists).
## Technical Implementation Planning
After completing your design phases, you can create detailed implementation plans that break down development work into manageable pieces. This phase transforms your designs into specific development tasks with clear dependencies and realistic timelines.
Start by identifying the minimum viable functionality needed to support a complete workflow from start to finish. For your control testing application, this probably means the ability to create a simple testing cycle, assign a control to an auditor, request and upload evidence, and generate basic documentation. Everything else, no matter how valuable, should be considered for later phases.
Create a detailed development roadmap that shows which features get built in what order, considering both user value and technical dependencies. You cannot build evidence collection workflows before you have basic control and user management in place. Similarly, you cannot create meaningful progress reporting until you have testing workflows that generate data to report on.
Think about this planning phase like creating a construction schedule that coordinates different teams of specialists. The foundation must be complete before you can frame walls, electrical work cannot begin before framing is finished, and painting happens only after everything else is ready. Software development follows similar dependency patterns that need to be planned carefully.
## Validation and Iteration Framework
Throughout this design process, you'll need mechanisms for validating that your design decisions actually solve the problems you identified in your requirements. Plan regular design reviews with potential users from your target market, focusing on whether your proposed workflows actually improve their current processes.
Create prototypes or mockups that you can test with audit professionals to validate your design assumptions. The goal is identifying design problems before they become development problems, which is much less expensive to fix. Consider bringing your designs to industry conferences or professional associations where you can get feedback from practitioners who deal with control testing challenges daily.
Remember that design is an iterative process, especially for specialized business applications where user needs are complex and nuanced. Plan for multiple design iterations as you learn more about how your target users actually work and what aspects of your solution create the most value.
## Connecting Design to Development
As you work through these design phases, maintain clear traceability back to your original requirements and business objectives. Every design decision should advance your primary goal of reducing control testing cycle time while maintaining quality and compliance standards.
Document your design decisions and the reasoning behind them, especially when you choose between alternative approaches. This documentation becomes invaluable during development when questions arise about why certain features work the way they do, and it provides context for future enhancement decisions.
The design phase sets the foundation for successful development by ensuring that your team understands not just what to build, but why each piece works the way it does. When developers understand the business logic behind design decisions, they can make better implementation choices and suggest improvements that align with your overall objectives.
Consider how you want to approach the first design phase - your data architecture. Do you want to start by creating detailed entity relationship diagrams, or would you prefer to begin with user journey mapping to better understand workflow requirements? The choice depends partly on whether you feel more confident about the data relationships or the user interaction patterns at this point.
